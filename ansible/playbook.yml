# Why do I need to disable swap on kubernetes
# The idea of kubernetes is to tightly pack instances to 
# as close to 100% utilized as possible. All deployments should be 
# pinned with CPU/memory limits. So if the scheduler sends a pod 
# to a machine it should never use swap at all. 
# You don't want to swap since it'll slow things down.
